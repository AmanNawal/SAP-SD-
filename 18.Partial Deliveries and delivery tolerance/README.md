## Partial Deliveries

* Partial delivery allows a sales order item to be delivered in multiple deliveries, instead of one single delivery for the full quantity.
* We can control the partial deliveries from customer master or at sales order level.

* ***Complete delivery required*** - will give us an error we do a partial delivery i.e., the picked quantity is less the total quantity.

* Complete delivery required and partia; delivery per item goes hand in hand.
