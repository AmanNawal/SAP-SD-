\## SAP Factory calendar



* T code for creating factory calendar - SCAL
* From SD point of view we assign factory calendar in sales organisation and shipping point. From MM POV it is assigned to plant.
* When assigned to sales org and shipping point, on certain days maintained as holiday the system wouldn't allow deliveries.
